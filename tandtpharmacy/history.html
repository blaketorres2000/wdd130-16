                    Onezippe Joseph (O.J.) Torres & Alvin (Bud) Torres are brothers who grew up in a tiny town in
                    Louisiana
                    called Golden Meadow. They grew up very poor. Their father was a part-time barber, and their mother
                    became
                    sick with tuberculosis and died when the boys were still very young. Their two older sisters married
                    and
                    moved to Vidor, Texas, where they worked as butchers and carpenters. With little money for a living,
                    the
                    two boys moved to Vidor with their sister Laura while they were just young teenagers.

                    While in school as a teenager, Bud got a job delivering milk on a truck. In the 11th grade, he
                    dropped out
                    of school to work at the Bethlehem Shipyards. Bud met Mary Briley while delivering milk, and courted
                    her
                    until they married. Mary was just 17 years old and still in high school. They kept their marriage a
                    secret
                    from the school until she graduated. World War II became a necessary part of their life plan when
                    Pearl
                    Harbor was attacked.

                    O.J. was drafted first and went on to serve in the Army Air Corps. He served in B-24 bombers over
                    Germany.
                    Later Bud was drafted in 1943 and was assigned to what was then a secret bomber, later named the
                    B-29 Super
                    Fortress. He served as a radio operator in the B-29 bombers. He flew in 23 missions over Japan, with
                    the
                    majority being over Tokyo. They both had heroin stories from their time in the service. They are
                    true
                    heroes.

                <p>
                    Both men returned home with plans to go to college. They attended Lamar University in Beaumont,
                    Texas for 2
                    years. When Bud finished his 2 year associates degree, the school discovered that he never finished
                    high
                    school. He then took a college entrance exam, and because he just finished two years of college, he
                    scored
                    very high on the exam. At that point the two brothers applied for dental school, but the school was
                    already
                    full and was not accepting new students. Someone informed them that a new pharmacy school was being
                    started
                    at the University of Houston. They both applied and were accepted. After 3 years of pharmacy school,
                    they
                    were part of the first graduating class of the pharmacy program at the University of Houston.

                    After graduation they found part-time work in Beaumont, Texas, but were having difficulties finding
                    steady
                    work. After a year of struggling for work, Bud transferred to Utah as a pharmacist. After 3 years of
                    working
                    in Utah, O.J. called Bud to tell him about a new pharmacy for sale in their little town of Vidor,
                    Texas. Bud
                    was excited for the opportunity to move back to Vidor.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When Bud returned to Vidor, O.J. was already working part-time at the new pharmacy. With a great
                    opportunity
                    to purchase the pharmacy, they acquired a $45,000 loan from a family friend in Houston. They
                    purchased the
                    pharmacy in January of 1955, and changed the name to T & T Pharmacy. The pharmacy also had a soda
                    fountain
                    with it that served two meals a day along with sodas, ice cream, and treats. The soda fountain was
                    really
                    popular and had long hours, 7am to 10pm. The brothers found temporary housing in Vidor and went to
                    work in
                    their new pharmacy. They had great success, and paid off their $45,000 loan in just 5 years.

                    Bud's oldest son, Gary, served a mission in the North Western States Mission for The Church of Jesus
                    Christ
                    of Latter-Day Saints. After he returned home from his 2 year mission, he attended BYU as a chemistry
                    major.
                    After a year of school, he changed his major to pre-pharmacy. A year later he applied to the
                    University of
                    Houston School of Pharmacy. One of the requirements for admission was to have an interview with the
                    dean of
                    the program. During his interview with the dean, Gary mentioned that his father and uncle were part
                    of the
                    first graduating class of the university's pharmacy program. The dean was so excited that he
                    accepted Gary's
                    application immediately. After 3 years, he graduated, and returned to Vidor to work with his father
                    and
                    uncle. He worked hard and helped the brothers build the pharmacy. Gary slowly worked his way into
                    ownership.
                    He eventually became full owner and has been here for over 54 years.

                    The pharmacy has become a staple in the small community of Vidor, Texas. Serving the community with
                    one goal
