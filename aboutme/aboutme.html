    <p>
        Hey y’all! My name is Blake Torres and I am from Vidor, TX. I have lived here my entire life except 
        for the years serving a mission in Ogden, UT. I work full time managing my family’s pharmacy. I am
        married to the best woman in the world. We just celebrated 15 years of marriage. We have 2 daughters 
        ages 6 & 3. They are so much fun and drive me nuts all at the same time. While I love to do so many 
        things (sports, hunting, fishing, anything outdoors, spending time with family, and much more) my 
        passion is woodworking. I love all types of woodwork, but fine furniture is my favorite. I am 
        majoring in applied technology. I plan to use it in our pharmacy and also in working for my 
        brother-in-law’s e-commerce company. I am really excited to dive into this class.
