    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <h3>Purpose</h3>
    <p>It is time to expand our white water rafting business. We have reached a point
      where it is important to have a website for the business. With a website, we
      will be able to reach a much larger audience. We will be able to have digital
      bookings that will keep us organized and help eliminate overbookings. We will
      be able to accept payments through the website. The website will have a history
      of our business to show potential customers that we have a wealth of knowledge
      about rafting, and therefore help to ease some of their concerns. Through the
      website we can give our potential customers a virtual experience that will
      excite them and prepare them for their future trips. These things will help to
      grow our business and expand our exposure.
    </p>

    <h3>Audience</h3>
    <p>The customers that we are trying to reach come from a broad range of people. Our
      business is geared to give everyone a great experience; from families just
      looking for a fun vacation, to those who are quite experienced. Many families
      are looking for some adventure to add to their vacation or even to build their
      vacation around. We can provide that for them. We can also accommodate the more
      experienced person by supplying them with the correct equipment and the
      knowledge that they will need of the river. The best way to target both of
      these demographics will be to advertize through other outdoor companies that
      have a much broader customer base over many areas of the outdoor culture. The
      majority of our customer base will most likely gain access to our site though
      a mobile device. We need to accommodate them by having a mobile friendly website.
